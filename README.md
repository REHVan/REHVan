## Introduction  
Hi, I’m Rafael, a curious techie who loves diving into code and new challenges. When I’m not tinkering with React components or exploring Ruby on Rails, you’ll find me strumming guitar chords, practicing Spanish, or sparring in the boxing ring. I’m driven by the thrill of solving puzzles and the joy of building tools that just make sense.
