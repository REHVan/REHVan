## Introduction  
Hi, I'm Rafael, a junior Computer Science major at USF who’s always pushing myself to learn, build, and make an impact. This summer at Chime I’ve shipped internal React & Rails tools used by 100+ support agents to review KYC and funding data. Before that, I cut my teeth at MTW Solutions in Kansas City, writing C# batch jobs and full-stack features that helped 200+ schools claim over $10 million in federal grants.  

As VP of External Affairs for SHPE USF, I lead a 7-person team to secure $10 000+ in sponsorships, host events with NASA, Goldman Sachs, and Amazon, and connect companies to our 1200+ members. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me learning guitar, practicing Spanish, boxing, or dancing bachata and salsa. Long term, I’m working toward launching my own tech startup to solve real-world problems at scale.
